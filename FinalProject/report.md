# Living in the city of Eindhoven

## Introduction

For the last few years I have been living in the city of Eindhoven, a small provincial town in the south of the Netherland and mostly known
for its high tech industries. For this reason it is sometimes called Silicon Valley of the Netherlands.
I like living here, and I'm living in a great neighbourhood. Unfortunately I cannot stay here: I'm currently residing in a social housing
project, and I'm getting too rich to stay here. I know: luxury problem.

So where in this city will I buy a new house? 

To figure this out I want to compare the various neighbourhoods in Eindhoven to see how similar they are, and finally figure out if there is a neighbourhood similar to mine where I could also live.
I will do this based on the different venues and ammenities available in the direct vicinity of the various neighbourhoods.

As in the course, I'd like to cluster neighbourhoods on similarity and show them on a map. Then I'd also like to create a decision tree that can show me the most important factors for choosing a certain neighbourhood.

## Data
To know more about Eindhoven I need as much data as possible. I found the following interesting datasets:

* A list of neighbourhoods in Eindhoven at [https://data.eindhoven.nl/explore/dataset/buurten/export/]. This includes
  * Name of neighbourhood (buurt), residential areas (wijken) and boroughs (stadsdeel) within Eindhoven,
  * their geographic coordinates,
  * their borders in GeoJSON format. 
* A table of key figures about the various neighbourhoods [https://opendata.cbs.nl/statline/#/CBS/nl/dataset/84286NED/table?ts=1546775064672], which includes things like
  * population,
  * population density, 
  * area,
  * amount of house
* A table of distances to popular amenities [https://opendata.cbs.nl/statline/#/CBS/nl/dataset/80306ned/table?ts=1546776064982], including distances like:
  * distance to park or forest,
  * distance to supermarket.
  
In addition I will use Foursquare to find popular venues close to each of the neighbourhoods. Using Foursquare might mean that I do not actually need the last of the tables above.
